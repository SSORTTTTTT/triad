# Triad roadmap

## Current testing version — 0.2.2 ("Triad v2")

- Multiband effects host: opens with 3 bands, add up to 10 while working, remove any.
- Effect slots per band in processing order (FL Studio mixer style), as many as needed: each band starts with Slot 1 and a "+ ADD SLOT" row underneath; every slot has its own dry/wet knob (value shown inside) and on/off light.
- Band Mix per band. VST3 and Audio Unit effects; effects-only plug-in list built without loading plug-ins inside the DAW (Triad Scanner helper for the rest).
- Live spectrum behind draggable crossovers; effect windows open on load.

## Notes for the next version (from Thomas, 2026-10-15) — not started

Do these with the LFO/routing work, once Thomas has tried 0.2.2 with his own plug-ins and sent the LFO and routing prompts. Guiding rule from Thomas: **make everyday use easy, with as few clicks as possible and nothing finicky.**

### Top priority: effect windows open on top of Triad

- Today a hosted effect's window can open **behind** Triad's window, so you have to move Triad aside to use the effect. **It must open in front of Triad**, with Triad visible behind it.
- Options to weigh: keep effect windows always in front of Triad (and of the DAW's plug-in window); and/or show the effect **inside Triad's own window**, as an overlay with a close/back button, since Triad is the host. Possibly a setting for which one.
- **Keyboard:** while an effect window has focus, FL Studio's spacebar (play/stop) does nothing, so you have to click out first. Pass keys the effect doesn't use (spacebar, transport shortcuts) back to the DAW, and don't hold keyboard focus unless the effect needs typing.

### Move a band's effects to another band

- Press and hold a band strip (or its header), drag it left or right, and drop it on another band position, e.g. drag Band 1's chain to Band 3. The bands in between shift over (or the two swap), with a clear "picked up" look and a drop marker while dragging.
- The frequency ranges stay where they are; the effect chain (slots, slot mixes, band mix, on/off states) moves to the new range. Use case: try a distortion on the lows, then the low-mids, without rebuilding the chain.
- To decide: whether a band's colour travels with its effects or stays with its position.

### Other notes

- **Remove a band from the crossover display**, not only with the × on its strip: right-click inside a band's area of the spectrum (or right-click a crossover dot) for a menu with "Remove band" (an "Add band here" item fits there too).
- **Smaller Triad window**: less square, more of a wide rectangle that takes less of the screen; later a size setting (e.g. 75% / 100% / 125%) and/or a resizable window.
- **Settings gear** at the top right, just left of "VST3 + AU EFFECTS / V2". First contents: the plug-in list ("Browse for a plug-in file", "Rescan for new plug-ins", "Rescan everything", how many effects were found, plug-ins that could not be checked). Window size goes here too. The same items can stay in the slot menu.
- **Band volume**: a simple level control on each band strip (a dB slider or knob, e.g. −24 dB to +12 dB, double-click for 0 dB) with a small dB readout/meter showing the band's level. Applied after the band's chain and Band Mix; automatable in the DAW like the band mixes.
- **In / Out meters on the spectrum display**: an input level meter and an output level meter (with dB readouts, e.g. peak and a held peak) at the side of the crossover/spectrum area, so you can compare what goes into Triad with what comes out.
- **Organising the effect list** (setting, in the gear menu):
  - Sort by **company** (today's layout, the default) or **A–Z by plug-in name** (one flat alphabetical list, company shown next to each name).
  - **Favourites**: mark an effect as a favourite (e.g. a star or right-click "Add to favourites" in the list); favourites appear in their own group at the top of the effect menu. Colour tags could come later.
  - Later: **most used** first, from how often each effect is loaded in Triad (counted on this Mac only).
- **Plug-in catalog**: already a saved file (`~/Library/Application Support/Triad/PluginCache-v2.xml`) that is reused instead of re-scanning; only new or changed plug-ins are checked. Possible setting: "check for new plug-ins automatically" on/off, so the folder check only runs when Rescan is pressed (like FL Studio / Ableton).

### Keep as they are (Thomas likes these)

- Effect list grouped as VST3 / Audio Units, then by company, then plug-in, with the separate "Not checked" group.
- "Browse for a plug-in file...", "Refresh plug-in list" and "Rescan all plug-ins" at the bottom of the slot menu.
- A different colour for each band.
- Each band starting with one slot and "+ ADD SLOT" underneath.

## Next: mix modulation / LFO tab

Add a dedicated mix-modulation/LFO tab:

- Placement (agreed with Thomas, 2026-10-15): a tab switch at the top of the window, in the area where "BAND CROSSOVERS" is now — **BANDS | LFO**. BANDS is today's view (crossover display and band strips); LFO opens the new section. Start this after 0.2.2 has been tried in FL Studio and Ableton.

- A point-based line editor for drawing each band's mix over time, inspired by the editing interaction in Gross Beat and ShaperBox.
- A way to link each band's Mix control (and possibly slot mixes) to its own envelope/LFO.
- Editable points and segments representing 0–100% mix.
- Tempo synchronization, cycle length, curves/steps, and interaction with the manual mix control to be settled when this phase begins.
- Routing between bands/effects is planned alongside the LFO work; Thomas will describe it when that phase starts.
- Thomas is researching how other plug-ins handle LFOs, including randomised LFOs, before writing the LFO prompts.

This is a saved development plan, not a scheduled background task.
